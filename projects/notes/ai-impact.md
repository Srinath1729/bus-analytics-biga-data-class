# AI Model for Predicting House Prices

The project aims to build an AI model that predicts house prices using features like size, location, and amenities. It involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data on house sales, including features (e.g., size, number of rooms, location) and target (sale price).
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data, including handling missing values and normalizing numerical features.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose a regression model, such as Linear Regression or Random Forest, for predicting house prices.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), and refine with cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
5. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict house prices based on input features.

The trained model can also be deployed as a web application or API for real-time predictions.
